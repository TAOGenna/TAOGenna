### Now
- 🔭 Research Intern at the [Radio Astronomy Institute, Pontifical Catholic University of Peru](https://www.pucp.edu.pe) focusing on computational aeronomy.
- Now trying to learn ML and GPU engineering | maybe maybe going back to Physics

### Recent
- ⚛️ Developed [a novel algorithm](https://github.com/TAOGenna/inversion-algorithm-plasma-frequency-profile) to reconstruct plasma frequency profiles during my internship at the Radio Science research group at [PUCP](https://www.pucp.edu.pe/en/). I also did a [machine learning program](https://github.com/TAOGenna/ionospheric-echo-detection-with-convolutional-neural-networks) to obtain o-mode EM wave echo traces.
- 🧑‍💻 Shipped features for the Fromsolvers project as a Software Engineer Intern, working with Docker, Django, and Pydantic.
- 📄 Completed M.Sc. in Theoretical Physics at the Bariloche Atomic Center and [Balseiro Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balseiro_Institute).
- 📑 Published research on interatomic repulsion effects in Majorana zero modes in *Physical Review B* [(Link)](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.075416), I was advised by [A. Aligia](https://scholar.google.com.ar/citations?user=T6qxAnkAAAAJ&hl=en).
- ⚛️ Investigated quantum chromatic numbers in graph theory as a Research Assistant at the University of São Paulo advised by [Yoshi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EC6p9kIAAAAJ&hl=en).
- 🏆 Top 25 in the ICPC South America Finals (2020, 2019).
- 🥇 Top 1.7% in the IEEExtreme programming competition (2021).
